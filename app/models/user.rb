	# To avoid this incompatibility, we’ll standardize on all lower-case addresses, converting “Foo@ExAMPle.CoM” to “foo@example.com” before saving it to the database. The way to do this is with a callback, which is a method that gets invoked at a particular point in the lifecycle of an Active Record object. In the present case, that point is before the object is saved, so we’ll use a before_save callback to downcase the email attribute before saving the user.
